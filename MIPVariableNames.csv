vmro3psv;Passive Ozone Volume Mixing Ratio;unset;Passive O3 (if available): The model runs should include a tracer to diagnose polar chemical ozone loss in winter and spring. As most models will advect (and integrate) O3 as part of the 'odd oxygen' (Ox=O3 + O(3P) + O(1D)) family we will call this the 'passive Ox tracer'. This will be a global tracer which is reset during each polar winter (i.e. twice per year). Given the relatively slow transport and long chemical lifetime (without PSC processing etc) of O3 in the polar regions this will provide a useful diagnostic over the timescale of a few months in the lower stratosphere. The model tracer should be set equal to your advected 'odd oxygen' tracer on December 1 and June 1 every year. Then, the tracer is simply advected without any further chemical change. If your advection scheme stores other variables for each tracer (e.g. higher order moments) remember to set sum of these species. The passive Ox tracer should be ouput according to the other instructions. The re-initialisation dates are selected so that we diagnose most of the chemical loss over the course of the winter, some of which would be missed by a later date.;[['CCMI1_daily']]
